# Albums-Dashboard
Albums-Dashborad is a personal project built with React and Sass. It works as a real time panel displaying my most listened albums in Spotify.

## Features
* This project uses the Last.fm API connected to my Spotify account to get real time data of my favorite albums, with 6 different sort options (7 days, past month, past 3 months, past 6 months, past year and historical).
* Clicking on an album displays a dinamically created page for each album, containing extra information like its release date, all its tracks with their duration, and the total number of plays that album has in Last.FM accounts.
* This project is fully responsive in mobile and tablet screens.
* A working demo is deployed with GitHub Pages [here](https://tomyalberdi.github.io/Albums-Dashboard/)
* The `build` and `deploy` processes are handled automatically with a YAML file located in the `.github/workflows` directory.
